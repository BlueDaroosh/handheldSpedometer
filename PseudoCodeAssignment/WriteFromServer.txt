Include libraries needed to run program
Include the header file wire.h
Include the header file Adafruit_Sensor.h
Include the header file Adafruit_ADXL345_U.h
Create 3 global variables of type float defining x,y,z axis, assigning the value 0 to them
Create a global variable that holds connection
Create a main function with an argument of void and returns void
Within the main block(
Create an if statement where it checks if the value returns false
Within the if block(
If argument is 0 from checking if device is connected, create a print statement that prints to console that the ADXL345 was not detected and you should check for the reason why
Call an exit function with argument 1
)
Assign the connection variable to the output of sql connect function with arguments of database address, user name, password, port, and connection type
Check if value of connection is null
Within the block(
If argument null create a print statement that prints to console “SQLITE connection failed”
Call exit function with argument of 1
)
Create a forever loop
Within block(
Assign values generated by sensor to global variables that define the x,y, and z axis
Call query function with the connection variable, and pass the queries to input variable values into data base
)
Call the function that will close the connection
